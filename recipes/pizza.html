    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Dough</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of
          flour, sugar, yeast, and salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add Wet Ingredients: Add the water and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Mix
          until the dough comes together.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knead the Dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead the
          dough for about 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Add more flour
          if the dough is too sticky.
        </li>
        <li>
          First Rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat.
          Cover with a damp cloth and let it rise in a warm place for about 1
          hour, or until doubled in size.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Prepare the Sauce</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine Sauce Ingredients: In a medium bowl, mix together the tomato
          sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder,
          sugar, salt, and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjust Seasoning: Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning if
          necessary. Set aside.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Preheat the Oven</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza
          stone, place it in the oven to heat up.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Shape the Dough</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prepare the Surface: Lightly flour your work surface. Punch down the
          dough and divide it into 2 equal portions if making two pizzas.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shape the Dough: Roll out or stretch the dough into your desired shape
          and thickness. Transfer the shaped dough onto a piece of parchment
          paper if using a pizza stone or onto a lightly oiled baking sheet.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Assemble the Pizza</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Add Sauce: Spread a thin layer of the prepared sauce over the dough,
          leaving a small border around the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add Cheese: Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese
          over the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add Toppings: Add your favorite toppings evenly over the cheese.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <li>Bake the Pizza</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Transfer to Oven: If using a pizza stone, carefully slide the pizza
          (with the parchment paper) onto the preheated stone. If using a baking
          sheet, place it directly in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake: Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and
          the cheese is bubbly and melted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cool: Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes
          before slicing.
        </li>
      </ol>
